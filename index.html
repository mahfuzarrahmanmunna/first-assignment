                        Dr. Muhammad Yunus is a Bangladeshi economist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate known as the 
                        "father of microfinance." He founded the Grameen Bank in 1983, providing small, collateral-free 
                        loans to empower the poor, especially women. Yunus introduced the concept of "social business," 
                        focusing on solving societal problems rather than maximizing profits. In 2006, he and Grameen Bank 
                        jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to combat poverty. His work has transformed global perspectives on
                         financial inclusion and inspired movements in social entrepreneurship.
